This mod changes boss health bars to look like Elden Ring's health bars. Though it isn't 100% accurate, I'd say it's close enough.

Note: After testing this with other mods, I noticed some mods can make bosses spawn with more HP than their maximum HP value which, in theory, would cause the boss bar to overflow. I made sure my bar doesn't overflow, so if you're hitting a boss and notice its health bar isn't decreasing, this might be why.
